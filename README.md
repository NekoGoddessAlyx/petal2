# Petal 2
Experimental hobbyist scripting language

# Goals \[todo!!!]

This project has the following goals:
* Lex ahead of time
* Provide robust messages from the compiler
* Recursion-free parser
* Flattened ast

The language itself is very much in development but the following is planned:
* Dynamically typed
* Classes with all members known ahead of time (no dynamic lookup *inside* of a class)

And finally, here is the wishlist:
* Optional static typing

None of the above is exhaustive

# What does it look like? \[todo!!!]
